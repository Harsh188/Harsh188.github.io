## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Harshith, welcome to my personal site! 

I'm currently an aspiring ML/CV Engineer, passionately pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. My research interests encompass a diverse range of topics in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

With the privilege of interning at Intel, contributing to Google Summer of Code, and researching at the Indian Institute of Science, I bring a rich tapestry of experiences.

My journey has been punctuated by multiple acceptances at top conferences, showcasing my commitment to excellence. Feel free to explore my research publications [here](publications.qmd).

<!-- When I'm not forcing matrix operations down my GPU, I try to partake in a load of activites. Explore the [fun](fun.qmd) page to see what I'm up to these days! -->
