## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Harshith, welcome to my personal site! 

I'm currently a Graduate Student Researcher at UC Riverside, where I'm passionately pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. My research interests encompass a diverse range of topics in the field of computer vision, computational photography and deep learning.

With the privilege of interning at Intel, contributing to Google Summer of Code, and being a research fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, I bring a rich tapestry of [experiences](experience/experience.qmd).

My journey has been punctuated by multiple acceptances at top conferences, showcasing my commitment to excellence. Feel free to explore my research publications [here](publications.qmd).

<!-- When I'm not forcing matrix operations down my GPU, I try to partake in a load of activites. Explore the [fun](fun.qmd) page to see what I'm up to these days! -->
